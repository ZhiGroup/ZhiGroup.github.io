**Population genetics informatics**

Modern biobanks include genotypes up to 0.1%-1% of an entire large population. At this scale, genetic relatedness among samples is unavoidably ubiquitous. However, current methods are not efficient for uncovering genetic relatedness at such a scale. We developed ultra-efficient methods [https://github.com/ZhiGroup/RaPID] for detecting Identical-by-Descent (IBD) segments, a primary embodiment of genetic relatedness. Our RaPID method detected all IBD segments over a certain length orders of magnitude faster than existing methods, while offering higher power, accuracy, and sharper IBD segment boundaries. 

We believe identifying IBD segments in population scale cohorts are the first step towards construction population scale genealogy which will be a fundamental infrastructure for future human society.

**Modeling of electronic health record (EHR) using deep learning**

Patients' health records and other health information are being collected and becoming available. This allows developing representation models that describe the inherent health status and treatment history of a patient. With access to multiple EHR databases with over 50 Million patients, We develop deep learning methods for uncovering the logic of medical practice and to help improve efficiency of clincial care.

**Modern bioinformatics using deep learning**

Deep learning is a powerful paradigm for modeling complex multi-modality data that is faced by modern biomedical research. We explore a variety of bioinformatics problems using deep learning approaches.
